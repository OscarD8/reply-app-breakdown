# Breakdown of Reply App

This is a practice project based on the **Android Basics with Compose** course Reply App, recreated from memory to test understanding of adaptive layouts and multi-device UI patterns.

## Overview
The app simulates a basic email client and demonstrates:
- **Adaptive layouts** using `WindowWidthSizeClass` for phones, tablets, and larger devices  
- **State-driven UI** for managing simpler screen states and navigation behavior  
- **Navigation patterns** across different screen sizes  
- **Instrumentation Testing** to verify UI components and adaptive behavior  

## Purpose
This project was built as a learning exercise to:
- Practice implementing canonical layouts - List and Detail, List only - adaptable across device types
- Explore **navigation strategies** for single- and dual-pane layouts  
- Gain confidence in **recreating a more complex sample app** without directly copying  

## Tech Stack
- **Kotlin**  
- **Jetpack Compose**  
- **Material 3**  
- **UI Tests with Compose Testing APIs**
